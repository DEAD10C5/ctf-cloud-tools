# DC31-Cloud-CTF

We all love this time of year and get busy during Defcon. But we also love puzzles and competition.

* [Defcon Cloud Village](https://cloud-village.org/)
* The main ask is you would give somewhere between 4 and 8 hours on the DC31 Cloud CTF.
  Help us get those flags.
* You may choose to remain an "anonymous" member of the team.
  (We might pick a nick name for you, sorry in advance?)
* [@devsecfranklin](https://github.com/devsecfranklin) is a member of the [#onlyfeet CTF group](https://ctftime.org/team/144644) so we can play under that banner, unless someone has a different/better idea.

## Roles

Spread out the work, speed up the win. These are some suggestions.

### Team Captain

* The team captain would be asked to lead the creation of the write-up after the event.
* Spend a few minutes on the web to see if there are any other useful write-ups.

### SecDev (or what is a good name for this?)

* Maintin our CTF container with our install scripts, cloud CLI tools, links and ref material, whatever team thinks is helpful.

## Communications

* There is a Discord that you will probably be asked to join, at least for the duration of the event.
  * (Open to other ideas as well)
* Please let the team captain know the best e-mail address for you.
* Think about how comfortable everyone is with sharing mobile number/signal. (Or what chat app might owrk?)

## Equipment

* Assume you will need a laptop, charger, phone.
* Need docker installed for tools container
* Might need a mi-fi for the team if we are on-site playing.

## Sponsorship

We have companies that are willing to contribute money for the bills:

* Github account seats
* Public Cloud bills

## Stretch Goals

* We might try the Container CTF at DC31 as well based on time/interest.
