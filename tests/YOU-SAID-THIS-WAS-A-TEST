hack on Jack
all and all
the cloud shall fall
by who hands
but the hands who hack

those sweet ports
shorts on ports
we all consort
with this Marlort

create regret 
make them upset
we came to get
this bread.

now let's pray
oh mighty cloud God, Zeus
We came to get this goose
She came to get the flag
